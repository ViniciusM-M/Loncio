Despite his esteemed position, Jon was led astray by the madness of his sister, Bodhi. She convinced Jon that he shouldn't be content with the power he possessed; that he deserved more.",
					"To seduce her brother, Bodhi shared magical secrets with Jon that she had learned from the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell. Using one of these secrets, Jon attempted to steal the life force from Suldanessellar's Tree of Life, believing it would grant him power on the level of the elven gods. The ritual failed and many elves nearly died as a result. For their crimes, Queen Ellesime cursed Jon and Bodhi, stripping them of their elven longevity and exiling them from the city. The elven people no longer recognized the siblings as their own kind and so the exiled siblings took new names. Joneleth Icarus became Jon Irenicus (an elven word meaning \"unclean\").",
					"Following his exile, Irenicus became obsessed with regaining the longevity that he had lost. He spent much of his time researching forbidden magic and engaging in horrific experimentation. Within his subterranean lair beneath the city of Athkatla, he tortured and studied mortal captives by means of twisted magic. One of those captives was the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, mortal son of the God of Murder. Jon sought to draw the divine spark out of Abdel and take it for himself. But Abdel escaped imprisonment and eventually hunted down and killed Jon, bringing his existence to a seemingly ignominious end.",
					"But that was not to be Jon's final fate. Due to a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell, Jon and Bodhi were drawn into a dark reflection of the treetop city in the Domain of Dread. Trapped and unable to escape the prison of his own making, Jon is still able to inflict misery on the elves of Suldanessellar with the help of his sister and their loyal followers.",
