					"Wolfweres are shapeshifters that have the natural form of a large wolf but can transform at will into both humanoid and bipedal hybrid shapes. These hateful creatures are much more intelligent than a normal wolf and use this preternatural cunning to hunt their favorite prey: humans. Although some believe them to be the offspring of werewolves and normal wolves—and this may very well be their origin—wolfweres are their own species and their form of lycanthropy is not a transmissible curse or disease. Like werewolves, wolfweres are repelled by wolfsbane but are vulnerable to iron rather than silver weapons.",

Unlike werewolves, wolfweres have no single humanoid form to revert to. Instead, a wolfwere can transform into any humanoid shape it desires, though they almost universally choose ones with great physical beauty. Wolfweres have the ability to sense what their particular prey would find attractive and assume a seductive disguise. Wolfweres have less control over their appearance when they involuntarily transform under a new moon, though they usually assume a shape they have taken on recently."
