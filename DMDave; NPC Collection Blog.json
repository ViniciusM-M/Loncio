Using one of these secrets, Jon attempted to steal the life force from Suldanessellar's Tree of Life, believing it would grant him power on the level of the elven gods. The ritual failed and many elves nearly died as a result. For their crimes, Queen Ellesime cursed Jon and Bodhi, stripping them of their elven longevity and exiling them from the city. The elven people no longer recognized the siblings as their own kind and so the exiled siblings took new names. Joneleth Icarus became Jon Irenicus (an elven word meaning \"unclean\").",

Within his subterranean lair beneath the city of Athkatla, he tortured and studied mortal captives by means of twisted magic. One of those captives was the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, mortal son of the God of Murder. Jon sought to draw the divine spark out of Abdel and take it for himself. But Abdel escaped imprisonment and eventually hunted down and killed Jon, bringing his existence to a seemingly ignominious end.",

							"\"Evil lurks everywhere. With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.",
							"In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.",
							"Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.",
							"Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted."

Using one of these secrets, Jon attempted to steal the life force from Suldanessellar's Tree of Life, believing it would grant him power on the level of the elven gods. The ritual failed and many elves nearly died as a result. For their crimes, Queen Ellesime cursed Jon and Bodhi, stripping them of their elven longevity and exiling them from the city. The elven people no longer recognized the siblings as their own kind and so the exiled siblings took new names. Joneleth Icarus became Jon Irenicus (an elven word meaning \"unclean\").",

Within his subterranean lair beneath the city of Athkatla, he tortured and studied mortal captives by means of twisted magic.

							"\"Evil lurks everywhere. With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.",
							"In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.",
							"Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.",
							"Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted."

					"Another quick one for my session today, I noticed that there is a serious lack of \"cleric\"-like NPCs in the monster books. We have the Priest in the Monster Manual with is a 5th-level caster and CR 2. And then we have the War Priest which is a huge jump up to 9th-level and CR 9 (also, its hit dice are way out of whack with its caster level). I need something in between (CR 5), so I decided to do a CR-forward cleric build.",
					"This is a little different way of building monsters than the way I outlined in my \"how to create a monster in 15 minutes or less\" article. While I have a rough concept in mind, I'm adding in its stats and hit points based on the challenge rating I want to set for it. The Dungeon Master Guide points people in this direction, but in my opinion, it's not always as fun.",
					"Regardless, it's what I need for my session tonight. Blah blah blah, anyways here's the damn thing.",
					"Hopefully, you can use this mid-level priest for your own adventures. Enjoy!",
